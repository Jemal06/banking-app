# Banking App

Java-based backend banking application designed as a full-featured project for mastering core and advanced Java development. The goal is to simulate a realistic backend system used in financial applications, while practicing essential programming concepts.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build a realistic backend architecture for a banking system
- Cover 80–90% of knowledge expected from a Junior–Middle Java Developer
- Practice OOP, abstraction, polymorphism, and other core principles
- Transition to Spring Framework in later stages
- Prepare a project that can serve as a portfolio piece for employment or freelance

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- Java OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, encapsulation)
- Bank account operations: deposit, withdraw, balance check
- User management and role-based access (to be extended)
- Modular, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Clean code principles

## ✅ Features (Work In Progress)

- [x] Basic user & account creation
- [x] Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- [x] CLI-based interaction (for now)
- [ ] Input validation & error handling
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Role system (admin/user)
- [ ] Spring Boot migration
- [ ] REST API endpoints
- [ ] Database persistence (JPA + PostgreSQL)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git + GitHub
- (Planned) Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is an actively developed learning project. Features and architecture will evolve as new concepts are studied and implemented. The aim is not just to "finish" the app but to learn deeply through real development experience.

## 📚 Learning Topics Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming
- SOLID principles
- Error handling and input validation
- Clean architecture basics
- CLI application design
- (Upcoming) Spring Boot, REST, DB integration

## 📦 Run Locally
